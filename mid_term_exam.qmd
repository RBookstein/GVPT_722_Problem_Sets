## Question 1

Imagine you hypothesize that the probability of voting for the incumbent in a two-candidate race is higher for people age 30 and older. Using the table of survey results below answer questions 1a, 1b, and 1c. Please show all of your work.

| Age          | Challenger | Incumbent | TOTAL |
|--------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| 18-29        | 300        | 100       | 400   |
| 30 and older | 500        | 100       | 600   |
| TOTAL        | 800        | 200       | 1000  |

: Voting for the Incumbent and Challenger by Age (cell counts)

### Part A

What is the probability of voting for the incumbent? (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

200/1000 = 0.2

Based on the math above, the probability of voting for the incumbent is 0.2 or 20 percent.

### Part B

What is the probability of being 18-29 **or** voting for the incumbent? Write the general (i.e. using symbols) formula you used to obtain your answer and show all of your work. (2 points)

::: callout-note
2/2
:::

P (A / B) = P (A) + P (B) - P( A and B)

(400/1000) + (200/1000) - (100/1000)

Based on the math above, the probability of being 18-29 or voting for the incumbent is 0.5 or 50 percent.

### Part C

In terms of the substantive results (ignore statistical significance), does the evidence support your hypothesis? Explain, using details, how you know (no more than 2 sentences). (5 points)

::: callout-note
2/5
:::

100/1000 = 0.1

100/1000 = 0.1

Based on the math above, the evidence does not support my hypothesis. This is because both 18-29 and 30 and older are both equally likely to vote for the incumbent.

::: callout-note
You need to look within the groups. What proportion of 18-29yos voted for the incumbent?
:::

## Question 2

A recent poll of 500 likely Republican voters includes 200 "highly educated" respondents and 300 "poorly educated" respondents. Both groups supported Donald Trump at the same rate. If you were to construct confidence intervals around these estimates, would the confidence interval be larger around the highly educated or poorly educated? Why? Answer in no more than one sentence. (2 points)

::: callout-note
2/2
:::

The confidence interval would be larger around the "highly educated", this is because confidence intervals are wider when sample sizes are smaller.

## Question 3

Provide a political science example of a continuous variable. (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

A political science example of a continuous variable would be the percentage of voter turnout in an election.

## Question 4

Use the information that follows to respond to the questions that come after **Table 2**.

The OLS regression results in **Table 2** were obtained from a survey of 1,500 citizens age 16 to 90 in European Union member nations. The p-values are from 2 tailed tests of significance.

**Dependent variable**:

-   European Parliament Feeling Thermometer ranging from 0 (coldest) to 100 (warmest).

**Independent variables**:Â 

-   Female: coded as equal to `1` for females and equal to `0` otherwise.

-   Education: coded as equal to `1` for those with 0 years of education, coded as equal to `2` for those with 1-8 years of education, coded as equal to `3` for those with 9-11 years of education, and coded as equal to `4` for those with 12 or more years of education.

| Independent variable | Coefficient | P-value |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| Constant             | 3           | 0.000   |
| Female               | -7          | 0.000   |
| Education            | 20          | 0.070   |

: Regression results

### Part A

In the context described above, is it useful to interpret the coefficient on the constant term on its own? If it is not useful to do so explain why it is not. If it is useful to do so explain what it reveals. Answer in no more than 2 sentences. (3 points)

::: callout-note
3/3
:::

In this context, the coefficient on the constant term is not useful on its own. This is because because the independent variable of `Education` not being able to equal zero and not providing us any predictive information into the model.

### Part B

Is the result for education statistically significant at the 5% error level? Answer **YES** or **NO** (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

The result for education is is not statistically significant at the 5% error level, this is because the p-value is higher than 0.05.

### Part C

Will a 95% confidence interval around the coefficient for education include 0? Answer **YES** or **NO** (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

Yes, a 95% confidence interval around the coefficient for education will include 0.

### Part D

What is the substantive meaning of the coefficient on the education variable (i.e. interpret the coefficient estimate)? Answer in one sentence. (3 points)

::: callout-note
2.5/3
:::

The substantive meaning of the coefficient on the education variable shows us that on average a one-unit increase in education is associated with an 20-unit increase feelings towards the European Parliment , holding all else constant.

::: callout-note
Use the specific units where possible.
:::

### Part F

Based on the results in **Table 2**, might the negative coefficient on `Female` be the result of females having less access to education? In no more than 1 sentence, explain your answer. (3 points)

::: callout-note
3/3
:::

The negative coefficient on `Female` is unlikely to be the result of females having less access to education, this is because when held constant to the `Education` variable the negative effect is still present.

## Extra credit

(3 points)

::: callout-note
3/3
:::

A recent study by Dr. Doofenshmirtz found that an in-class presentation on voting from a fellow student increased the rate of voter registration among high school students in the U.S. by 3 percentage points. On a quantitative methods exam Zuri, Jesse, and Teddy were asked if the effect was substantively significant. The question they were asked did not give any information about statistical significance. The answers they provided follow.

Zuri: The effect is not substantively significant because the rate of registration among high school students is very low and even with a 3 percentage point increase will be low and lower than in other democracies.

Jesse: We just don't know because there isn't any information about statistical significance.

Teddy: The effect is substantively significant because in a close election, the additional people who registered could change the outcome.

Which of the following provides the best evaluation of the above answers?

A.  Jesse would be marked as correct, and the others as incorrect

B.  Teddy would be marked as correct, and the others as incorrect

C.  Zuri would be marked as correct, and the others as incorrect

D.  Zuri and Jesse would both be marked correct, and Teddy as incorrect

E.  Zuri and Teddy would both be marked correct, and Jesse as incorrect

Based on the information, Answer E provides the best evaluations of the above answers.
